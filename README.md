# 🧠 Structured Output Generation With AI

This project demonstrates three progressively advanced approaches to converting unstructured data into structured formats using large language models (LLMs). Here we used latest Llama 4 model from groq (model service provider)

## 📦 What's Inside

1. 🧱 **Pydantic**  
   A straightforward baseline using Pydantic models to define structured outputs.

2. 🧑‍🏫 **Instructor**  
   Uses the `Instructor` library to enhance structured generation with automatic retries and validation.

3. 🧬 **Outlines** *(Most Advanced)*  
   Leverages `Outlines` for fine-grained control over output formats — supports more than just JSON, including formats like HTML, CSV, and custom patterns.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Structured generation from LLMs is critical for reliable downstream processing in AI pipelines. This repo shows how to level up from basic JSON parsing to flexible, robust structured outputs.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Structured output validation with minimal boilerplate
- 🔁 Automatic retries on format mismatch (Instructor)
- 🔧 Support for custom output formats beyond JSON (Outlines)
- 📈 Progressive complexity for learning and comparison
- 🧪 Tested with Groq's LLaMA models and OpenAI-compatible endpoints
